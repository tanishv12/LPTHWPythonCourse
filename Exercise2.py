#CommentsAndPoundCharacters   I use this to identify which program is in use.

#A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
#Anything after # is ignored by Python.

print("I could have code like this.")# and the comment after is ignored

#You can also comment to remove some part of code like 
#print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")
