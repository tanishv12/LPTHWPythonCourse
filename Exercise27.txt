The Truth Terms
In Python we have the following terms (characters and phrases) for determining if something is ”True”
or ”False.” Logic on a computer is all about seeing if some combination of these characters and some
variables is True at that point in the program.
• and
• or
MEMORIZING LOGIC 129
• not
• != (not equal)
• == (equal)
• >= (greater-than-equal)
• <= (less-than-equal)
• True
• False
You actually have run into these characters before but maybe not the terms. The terms (and, or, not)
actually work the way you expect them to, just like in English.
The Truth Tables
We will now use these characters to make the truth tables you need to memorize.
NOT True?
not False True
not True False
OR True?
True or False True
True or True True
False or True True
False or False False
AND True?
True and False False
True and True True
False and True False
False and False False
NOT OR True?
not (True or False) False

NOT OR True?
not (True or True) False
not (False or True) False
not (False or False) True
NOT AND True?
not (True and False) True
not (True and True) False
not (False and True) True
not (False and False) True
!= True?
1 != 0 True
1 != 1 False
0 != 1 True
0 != 0 False
== True?
1 == 0 False
1 == 1 True
0 == 1 False
0 == 0 True
Now use these tables to write up your own cards and spend the week memorizing them. Remember
though, there is no failing in this book, just trying as hard as you can each day, and then a little bit more.
